== NAME

coresched - manage core scheduling cookies for tasks

== SYNOPSIS

*coresched* [options] *-p* _pid_

*coresched* [options] \-- _command_ [_argument_...]

== DESCRIPTION
The *coresched* command is used to retrieve or modify the core scheduling cookies of a running process given its _pid_, or to spawn a new _command_ with core scheduling cookies.

Core scheduling allows you to define groups of tasks that are allowed to share a physical core.
This is done by assigning a cookie to each task.
Only tasks have the same cookie are allowed to be scheduled on the same physical core.

It is possible to either assign a new random cookie to a task, or copy a cookie from another task. It is not possible to choose the value of the cookie.

== FUNCTIONS
*-n*, *--new*::
Assign a new cookie to an existing PID or to execute _command_ with a new cookie.

*-c*, *--copy*::
Copy the cookie from an existing PID to another PID, or execute _command_ with that copied cookie.

== OPTIONS
*-p*, *--pid* _PID_::
Operate on an existing PID and do not launch a new task.

*-d*, *--dest* _PID_::
When using *--copy*, specify a destination PID where you want to copy the cookie to.

*-t*, *--type* _TYPE_::
The type of the PID whose cookie will be modified. This can be one of three values:
- *pid*, or process ID
- *tgid*, or thread group ID
- *pgid*, or process group ID

*-v*, *--verbose*::
Show extra information when modifying cookies of tasks.

*-h*, *--help*::
Display help text and exit.

*-V*, *--version*::
Print version and exit.
